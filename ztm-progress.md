#### Web and Computing Fundamentals

- [x] [ZTM Crash Course Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kS3M8a6kP8&list=RDCMUCt7T2EvYBqvlxNU3fbE4Y7g&index=1) - first 40 minutes

*Takeaways:*
- Internet backbone diagram @ 13:00
- WILD diagram of the internet @ 16:30. Network of networks!
- ```traceroute```
- Three ways to increase website speed:
   1. Location of server
   2. How many trips (request/response)
   3. Size of files
- WWW !== The Internet
  - Internet is the network itself (infrastructure)
  - WWW is built on top of the internet, a collection of information that uses http as communication protocol (agreed-upon language, of sorts)
  - Analogy: Internet is bookstore, WWW is the collection of books in the store
- Old way (early 2000s)
  - JQuery
  - LAMP stack (Linux, MySQL, Apache, PHP)

*Action: Recommend this for Phase 1 students. Also try using balsamiq or similar for teaching, very cool!*
